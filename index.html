        <p> This is a website for OsloMet Pilestredet 35. Here I will introduce what this website is about.
            We have been given the task of creating a website for Oslomet and specifically for building P35.
            This website is divided into four pages: introduction page, topical page, accessibility test page and a page
            for pictures of OsloMet and Ellen Gleditsch. The topical page will mainly be about OsloMet P35 and Ellen Gleditsch.
            The accessibility test page is where we are evaluating digital products to ensure they can be used effectively by individuals with disabilities.
