            We have been given the task of creating a website for Oslomet and specifically for building Pilestredet 35.
            This website is divided into four pages: Introduction page, topical page, accessibility test page and a page
            for pictures of OsloMet and Ellen Gleditsch. The topical page will mainly be about OsloMet Pilestredet 35 and Ellen Gleditsch.
            The accessibility test page is where we are evaluating digital products to ensure they can be used effectively by individuals with disabilities.
