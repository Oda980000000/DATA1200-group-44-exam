        <p>ODGAJE is committed to providing a website that is accessible to <br>
            the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or abilities. <br>
            We will continiuosly improve our site by acquiring knowledge about <br>
            new technologies and gain experience by including these in our scope. <br>
            During this project we will strive to provide an <br>
            accessible, optimized and well-rounded user experience. <br> <!--(nomensa.com)-->
        </p>

        <h3 class="green-subheadings">Our Journey towards an Accessible Website</h3>
           <p>We started by researching the subject matter and found <br>
            some key points from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) <br>
            that we'd like to highlight on this page as seen in the box to your right. <br>
            Because we started said research some time after initializing the website, some changes were due.<br>
            </p>
            
            <p>We decided to direct our initial focus on a straightforward menu with logically arranged clickable elements.<br>
            While testing out colorschemes we found a theme that could be aestethically pleasing as well as accessible.<br>
            We also wanted to make sure the website offered alternative<br>
            navigation methods using keyboard shortcuts. <br>
            We tested these keyboard features by ensuring that TAB, SPACE
            and arrow keys could be used to navigate the site and ENTER activated the current selection.<br>
            </p>
        

        <h4 class="green-subheadings">Unexpected Findings</h4>
        <p>In the effort to implement the code to create the website, we emphasized carefully selected code segments
        that were designed to ensure an efficient and functional website solution. Our focus was thorough and we identified specific
        areas that were critical to achieving our objectives. These areas included optimized performance, ease of use and aesthetic appeal.
        Through a thorough approach to these aspects, we ensured that the website not only met, but also exceeded our expectations. 
        <br>
        When enhancing web accessibility, it's crucial to incorporate various practices. We began by adding alternative text to images, declaring the language, and using clear and concise language.
        Then we kept writing brief sentences, replaced dashes with ranges (e.g., 1 to 3), and avoided abbreviations in favor of full words (e.g., February instead of Feb). We also focused to steer clear
        of slang words and carefully choose colors, ensuring high contrast. The link text needed to be descriptive, good link colors during hover or after use, descriptive headings. Craft descriptive URLs, avoid small font sizes,
        and facilitate keyboard navigation. Then we ensured multimedia accessibility, structure content logically. Finally, we regularly checked that the site maintains its accessibility standards.
