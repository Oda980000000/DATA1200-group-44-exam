            <br>
            <p> OsloMet's history has roots that stretch back more than 200 years, and has come about as a result 
                of a connection between several different research and educational institutions. 
                <br>
                From 1994, these various schools were integrated into either Oslo University College or Akershus University College, 
                which then merged in 2011 to become Oslo University College and Akershus HiOA. 
                <br>
                In 2018, HiOA received university status and changed its name to OsloMet - metropolitan university.
                <br>
                The university has its main campus at Pilestredet in Oslo, as well as one at Kjeller in Skedsmo.

                <p> Ellen Gleditsch was born in 1879 and grew up in Tromsø. She was a chemist and 
                    was, among other things, a research assistant for Marie Curie. 
                    <br>
                    Gleditsch herself became a pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry with her discovery of a more accurate determination of radium's half-life. 
                    <br>
                    She was Norway's first specialist in radioactivity and became Norway's second female professor. 
                    <br>
                    For her important achievements, she was honored with awards such as an honorary doctorate at the University of Sorbonne and the University of Strasbourg. In addition, she was also created as a Knight of the 1st class of the Norwegian Order of St. Olav.
