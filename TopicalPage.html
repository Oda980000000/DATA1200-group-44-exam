            OsloMet's history has roots that stretch back more than 200 years, and has come about as a result 
            of a connection between several different research and educational institutions. 
            <br>
            From 1994, these various schools were integrated into either Oslo University College or Akershus University College, 
            which then merged in 2011 to become Oslo University College and Akershus HiOA. 
            <br>
            In 2018, HiOA received university status and changed its name to OsloMet - metropolitan university.
            <br>
            The university has its main campus at Pilestredet in Oslo, as well as one at Kjeller in Skedsmo.
