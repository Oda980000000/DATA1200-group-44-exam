            <p> 
                OsloMet's history has roots that stretch back more than 200 years, and has come about as a result 
                of a connection between several different research and educational institutions. 
                <br>
                From 1994, these various schools were integrated into either Oslo University College or Akershus University College, 
                which then merged in 2011 to become Oslo University College and Akershus HiOA. 
                <br>
                In 2018, HiOA received university status and changed its name to OsloMet - metropolitan university.
                <br>
                The university has its main campus at Pilestredet in Oslo, as well as one at Kjeller in Skedsmo.

            OsloMet's  main campus is located on Pilestredet in Oslo, 
            where a number of the university's buildings consist of the old premises of the Frydenlund brewery.
            Which was once one of the country's largest beer breweries.
            <br>
            Now it consists of classrooms, auditoriums, canteens, libraries and reading rooms.
